### Problem : 

Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Many prostate cancers grow slowly and are confined to the prostate gland, where they may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly.

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to detect the presence of Prostate Cancer in an individual features using the Random Forest Classifier.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can predict the occurrence of a cardiac arrest or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors.
