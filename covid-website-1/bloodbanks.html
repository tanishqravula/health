                        A blood test result more typically seen in disorders associated with bone marrow diseases was found in a patient with COVID-19, a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  COVID-19 is a complex infection that, much like the lungs or the heart can cause damage to the blood flowing through your veins, which is vital to healthy functioning.<br>
                    <br>

                    Blood clotting, which can disrupt blood flow can cause symptoms that can be mild or even threatening. To put it simply, if a blood clot blocks the passage of blood flowing through an artery or vein, it causes tissue damage and oxygen deprivation, which can make the cells in that tissue die.
                    <br><br>
                    While some blood clotting is considered normal, what makes it scary in COVID-19 cases is abnormal clotting.

                The damage COVID-19 does for the two vital organs, the heart and the lungs, and the many symptoms it can unleash has been detailed before.
                <br><br>
                According to many doctors, a strong reason why even healthy patients end up suffering from problems like these is acute blood clotting. Increased pressure, clotting can lead to disturbances and severe signs weeks, or even months after fighting the virus.
                <br><br>
                A study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine observed that blood clots can clog up the lungs and cause problems, including shortness of breath.
