            <h2>HOW IT SPREADS</h2>
            The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
            You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
            <h2>MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS : </h2> 
            <ul>    
                
                <li>fever</li>
                <li>dry cough</li>
                <li>tiredness</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>LESS COMMOM SYMPTOMS : </h2>
            <ul>
            <li>aches and pains</li>
                <li>sore throat</li>
                <li>diarrhoea</li>
                <li>conjunctivitis</li>
                <li>headache</li>
                <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
                <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
            To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
            <ul>
            <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
            <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
            <li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
            <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
            <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
            <li>Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class ="maskContent">
            <h2>MASKS</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others.</li>
            <li>Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. </li>
            <li>Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</li>
            </ul>
