Below are the prediction model training created to check the probability of getting
heart attack by analysing the patient’s age, gender, exercise induced angina, 
number of major vessels, chest pain indication, resting blood pressure, 
cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, 
and maximum heart rate achieved.
